  abstract = {With emergence of blockchain technologies and the associated cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, understanding network dynamics behind Blockchain graphs has become a rapidly evolving research direction. Unlike other financial networks, such as stock and currency trading, blockchain based cryptocurrencies have the entire transaction graph accessible to the public (i.e., all transactions can be downloaded and analyzed). A natural question is then to ask whether dynamics of the transaction graph impacts price of the underlying cryptocurrency. We show that standard graph features such as degree distribution of the transaction graph may not be sufficient to capture network dynamics and its potential impact on fluctuations of Bitcoin price. In contrast, topological features computed from the blockchain graph using the tools of persistent homology, are found to exhibit higher utility for predicting Bitcoin price dynamics.},

  abstract = {We present here several variants of a mathematical model to explore three main issues related to SARS-CoV-2 spread in scenarios similar to those present in Mexico and elsewhere in Latin America. We explore the consequences for travel inside a given region, in this case Mexico, particularly focusing on airplane transportation but attempting to give a gross approximation to terrestrial movement since this is the main form of population movement across geographical areas in the country; then we proceed to study the effect of behavioral changes required to lower transmission by lowering the contact rate and infection probability and lastly, we explore the consequences of disease spread in a population subject to social isolation.These models are not suitable for predictive purposes although some rough predictions can be extracted from them. They are presented as a tool that can serve to explore plausible scenarios of spread and impact, effectiveness and consequences of contention and mitigation policies. Given the early stage at which the epidemic is at the date of writing in Mexico, we hope these ideas can be helpful for the understanding of the importance of isolation, social distancing and screening of the general population.},

  abstract = {Data is often at the core of digital products and services, especially when related to online advertising. This has made data protection and privacy a major policy concern. When surfing the web, consumers leave digital traces that can be used to build user profiles and infer preferences. We quantify the extent to which Facebook can track web behavior outside of their own platform. The network of engagement buttons, placed on third-party websites, lets Facebook follow users as they browse the web. Tracking users outside its core platform enables Facebook to build shadow profiles. For a representative sample of US internet users, 52 percent of websites visited, accounting for 40 percent of browsing time, employ Facebook’s tracking technology. Small differences between Facebook users and non-users are largely explained by differing user activity. The extent of shadow profiling Facebook may engage in is similar on privacy-sensitive domains and across user demographics, documenting the possibility for indiscriminate tracking.},

Machine learning classification algorithms reach about 55–65\% predictive accuracy on average at the daily or minute level frequencies, while the support vector machines demonstrate the best and consistent results in terms of predictive accuracy compared to the logistic regression, artificial neural networks and random forest classification algorithms.},

  abstract = {There are numerous characterizations of Shannon entropy and Tsallis entropy as measures of information obeying certain properties. Using work by Faddeev and Furuichi, we derive a very simple characterization. Instead of focusing on the entropy of a probability measure on a finite set, this characterization focuses on the ‘information loss’, or change in entropy, associated with a measure-preserving function. Information loss is a special case of conditional entropy: namely, it is the entropy of a random variable conditioned on some function of that variable. We show that Shannon entropy gives the only concept of information loss that is functorial, convex-linear and continuous. This characterization naturally generalizes to Tsallis entropy as well.},

  abstract = {We study the problem of predicting whether the price of the 21 most popular cryptocurrencies (according to coinmarketcap.com) will go up or down on day d, using data up to day d−1. Our C2P2 algorithm is the first algorithm to consider the fact that the price of a cryptocurrency c might depend not only on historical prices, sentiments, global stock indices, but also on the prices and predicted prices of other cryptocurrencies. C2P2 therefore does not predict cryptocurrency prices one coin at a time — rather it uses similarity metrics in conjunction with collective classification to compare multiple cryptocurrency features to jointly predict the cryptocurrency prices for all 21 coins considered. We show that our C2P2 algorithm beats out a recent competing 2017 paper by margins varying from 5.183\% and another Bitcoin-specific prediction paper from 2018 by 16\%. In both cases, C2P2 is the winner on all cryptocurrencies considered. Moreover, we experimentally show that the use of similarity metrics within our C2P2 algorithm leads to a direct improvement for 20 out of 21 cryptocurrencies ranging from 0.4\% to 17.8\%. Without the similarity component, C2P2 still beats competitors on 20 out of 21 cryptocurrencies considered. We show that all these results are statistically significant via a Student’s t-test with p {$<$} 10−5.},

Because of its highly volatile nature, there is a need for good predictions on which to base investment decisions. Although existing studies have leveraged machine learning for more accurate Bitcoin price prediction, few have focused on the feasibility of applying different modeling techniques to samples with different data structures and dimensional features. To predict Bitcoin price at different frequencies using machine learning techniques, we first classify Bitcoin price by daily price and high-frequency price. A set of high-dimension features including property and network, trading and market, attention and gold spot price are used for Bitcoin daily price prediction, while the basic trading features acquired from a cryptocurrency exchange are used for 5-minute interval price prediction. Statistical methods including Logistic Regression and Linear Discriminant Analysis for Bitcoin daily price prediction with high-dimensional features achieve an accuracy of 66\%, outperforming more complicated machine learning algorithms. Compared with benchmark results for daily price prediction, we achieve a better performance, with the highest accuracies of the statistical methods and machine learning algorithms of 66\% and 65.3\%, respectively. Machine learning models including Random Forest, XGBoost, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, Support Vector Machine and Long Short-term Memory for Bitcoin 5-minute interval price prediction are superior to statistical methods, with accuracy reaching 67.2\%. Our investigation of Bitcoin price prediction can be considered a pilot study of the importance of the sample dimension in machine learning techniques.},

A set of high-dimension features including property and network, trading and market, attention and gold spot price are used for Bitcoin daily price prediction, while the basic trading features acquired from a cryptocurrency exchange are used for 5-minute interval price prediction. Statistical methods including Logistic Regression and Linear Discriminant Analysis for Bitcoin daily price prediction with high-dimensional features achieve an accuracy of 66\%, outperforming more complicated machine learning algorithms. Compared with benchmark results for daily price prediction, we achieve a better performance, with the highest accuracies of the statistical methods and machine learning algorithms of 66\% and 65.3\%, respectively. Machine learning models including Random Forest, XGBoost, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, Support Vector Machine and Long Short-term Memory for Bitcoin 5-minute interval price prediction are superior to statistical methods, with accuracy reaching 67.2\%. Our investigation of Bitcoin price prediction can be considered a pilot study of the importance of the sample dimension in machine learning techniques.},

  abstract = {In recent years, Bitcoin exchange rate prediction has attracted the interest of researchers and investors. Some studies have used traditional statistical and econometric methods to understand the economic and technology determinants of Bitcoin, few have considered the development of predictive models using these determinants. In this study, we developed a two-stage approach for exploring whether the information hidden in economic and technology determinants can accurately predict the Bitcoin exchange rate. In the first stage, two nonlinear feature selection methods comprising an artificial neural network and random forest are used to reduce the subset of potential predictors by measuring the importance of economic and technology factors. In the second stage, the potential predictors are integrated into long short-term memory (LSTM) to predict the Bitcoin exchange rate regardless of the previous exchange rate. Our results showed that by using the economic and technology determinants, LSTM could achieve better predictive performance than the autoregressive integrated moving average, support vector regression, adaptive network fuzzy inference system, and LSTM methods, which all use the previous exchange rate. Thus, information obtained from economic and technology determinants is more important for predicting the Bitcoin exchange rate than the previous exchange rate.},

Since the 1960s, mathematicians have used computers to assist in the discovery of patterns and formulation of conjectures               1               , most famously in the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture               2               , a Millennium Prize Problem               3               . Here we provide examples of new fundamental results in pure mathematics that have been discovered with the assistance of machine learning—demonstrating a method by which machine learning can aid mathematicians in discovering new conjectures and theorems. We propose a process of using machine learning to discover potential patterns and relations between mathematical objects, understanding them with attribution techniques and using these observations to guide intuition and propose conjectures. We outline this machine-learning-guided framework and demonstrate its successful application to current research questions in distinct areas of pure mathematics, in each case showing how it led to meaningful mathematical contributions on important open problems: a new connection between the algebraic and geometric structure of knots, and a candidate algorithm predicted by the combinatorial invariance conjecture for symmetric groups               4               . Our work may serve as a model for collaboration between the fields of mathematics and artificial intelligence (AI) that can achieve surprising results by leveraging the respective strengths of mathematicians and machine learning.},

In contrast to fiat currencies, all transactions of crypto-currencies and cryptotokens are permanently recorded on distributed ledgers and are publicly available. This allows us to construct a transaction graph and to assess not only its organization but to glean relationships between transaction graph properties and crypto price dynamics. The goal of this paper is to facilitate our understanding on horizons and limitations of what can be learned on crypto-tokens from local topology and geometry of the Ethereum transaction network whose even global network properties remain scarcely explored. By introducing novel tools based on Topological Data Analysis and Functional Data Depth into Blockchain Data Analytics, we show that Ethereum network (one of the most popular blockchains for creating new crypto-tokens) can provide critical insights on price changes of crypto-tokens that are otherwise largely inaccessible with conventional data sources and traditional analytic methods.},

However, with the recent advancement in the computational capacity of computers and more importantly developing more advanced machine learning algorithms and approaches such as deep learning, new algorithms have been developed to forecast time series data.

Multiple examples are included throughout the work containing useful computer code that can be applied directly to real-world trading models. Individual case studies are split up into smaller modules for impact and retention. Chapters contain a balanced mix of mathematics, finance, and programming theory, and cover such topics as linear algebra, matrix manipulations, statistics, data analysis, and programming constructs. Upon completion of the book, readers will know how to research, analyze, backtest, and code up a successful trading strategy. "--},

  abstract = {We explore the evolution of daily returns of four major US stock market indices during the technology crash of 2000, and the financial crisis of 2007–2009. Our methodology is based on topological data analysis (TDA). We use persistence homology to detect and quantify topological patterns that appear in multidimensional time series. Using a sliding window, we extract time-dependent point cloud data sets, to which we associate a topological space. We detect transient loops that appear in this space, and we measure their persistence. This is encoded in real-valued functions referred to as a ’persistence landscapes’. We quantify the temporal changes in persistence landscapes via their Lp-norms. We test this procedure on multidimensional time series generated by various non-linear and non-equilibrium models. We find that, in the vicinity of financial meltdowns, the Lp-norms exhibit strong growth prior to the primary peak, which ascends during a crash. Remarkably, the average spectral density at low frequencies of the time series of Lp-norms of the persistence landscapes demonstrates a strong rising trend for 250 trading days prior to either dotcom crash on 03/10/2000, or to the Lehman bankruptcy on 09/15/2008. Our study suggests that TDA provides a new type of econometric analysis, which complements the standard statistical measures. The method can be used to detect early warning signals of imminent market crashes. We believe that this approach can be used beyond the analysis of financial time series presented here.},

  abstract = {Many traders participate in activities known as "day-trading", trading Bitcoin against the dollar bill as the United States Dollar (USD) on very short timeframes to squeeze out profits from small market fluctuations. This paper aims to help traders decide how to best act by creating a model that can predict price movement’s direction for the next 5-min time frame. Several machinelearning models have been tested for this Up/Down binary-classification problem. In this paper, we provide a comparison of the state-of-art strategies in predicting the movement direction for bitcoin, including Random Guessing and a Momentum-Based Strategy. The tested models include Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Prophet (by Facebook), Random Forest, Random Forest Lagged-Auto-Regression, and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Neural Net­ works. The MLP deep neural network has achieved the highest accuracy of 54\% compared to other time-series prediction models. Also, in this paper, various data transformation and feature engineering have been applied in the comparison.},

Given a number of egregious privacy breaches, there is a clear unmet need for greater transparency and control over data collection, sharing, and use by smart speaker platforms as well as third party skills supported on them. To bridge the gap, we build an auditing framework that leverages online advertising to measure data collection, its usage, and its sharing by the smart speaker platforms. We evaluate our framework on the Amazon smart speaker ecosystem. Our results show that Amazon and third parties (including advertising and tracking services) collect smart speaker interaction data. We find that Amazon processes voice data to infer user interests and uses it to serve targeted ads on-platform (Echo devices) as well as off-platform (web). Smart speaker interaction leads to as much as 30× higher ad bids from advertisers. Finally, we find that Amazon’s and skills’ operational practices are often not clearly disclosed in their privacy policies.},

We use a comprehensive feature set, including technical, blockchain-based, sentiment-/interest-based, and asset-based features. Our results show that technical features remain most relevant for most methods, followed by selected blockchain-based and sentiment-/interest-based features. Additionally, we find that predictability increases for longer prediction horizons. Although a quantile-based long-short trading strategy generates monthly returns of up to 39\% before transaction costs, it leads to negative returns after taking transaction costs into account due to the particularly short holding periods.},

Correspondingly, many researchers have investigated various factors that affect the Bitcoin price and the patterns behind its fluctuations, in particular, using various machine learning methods. In this paper, we study and compare various state-of-the-art deep learning methods such as a deep neural network (DNN), a long short-term memory (LSTM) model, a convolutional neural network, a deep residual network, and their combinations for Bitcoin price prediction. Experimental results showed that although LSTM-based prediction models slightly outperformed the other prediction models for Bitcoin price prediction (regression), DNN-based models performed the best for price ups and downs prediction (classification). In addition, a simple profitability analysis showed that classification models were more effective than regression models for algorithmic trading. Overall, the performances of the proposed deep learning-based prediction models were comparable.},

The Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) for QSAR model validation recommended as principle 3 “A defined domain of applicability” to be present for a predictive QSAR model. The study of AD allows estimating the uncertainty in the prediction for a particular molecule based on how similar it is to the training compounds which are used in the model development. In the current scenario, AD represents an active research topic, and many methods have been designed to estimate the competence of a model and the confidence in its outcome for a given prediction task. Thus, characterization of interpolation space is significant in defining the AD. The diverse set of reported AD methods was constructed through different hypotheses and algorithms. These multiplicities of methodologies mystify the end users and make the comparison of the AD for different models a complex issue to address. We have attempted to summarize in this chapter the important concepts of AD including particulars of the available methods to compute the AD along with their thresholds and criteria for estimating AD through training set interpolation in the descriptor space. The idea about transparent domain and decision domain are also discussed. To help readers determine the AD in their projects, practical examples together with available open source software tools are provided.},

Aims: This study assesses the impact of systematic literature reviews (SLRs) which are the recommended EBSE method for aggregating evidence. Method: We used the standard systematic literature review method employing a manual search of 10 journals and 4 conference proceedings. Results: Of 20 relevant studies, eight addressed research trends rather than technique evaluation. Seven SLRs addressed cost estimation. The quality of SLRs was fair with only three scoring less than 2 out of 4. Conclusions: Currently, the topic areas covered by SLRs are limited. European researchers, particularly those at the Simula Laboratory appear to be the leading exponents of systematic literature reviews. The series of cost estimation SLRs demonstrate the potential value of EBSE for synthesising evidence and making it available to practitioners.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, cryptocurrency has infiltrated almost all financial transactions; thus, it is generally recognized as an alternative method for paying and exchanging currency. Cryptocurrency trade constitutes a constantly increasing financial market and a promising type of profitable investment; however, it is characterized by high volatility and strong fluctuations of prices over time. Therefore, the development of an intelligent forecasting model is considered essential for portfolio optimization and decision making. The main contribution of this research is the combination of three of the most widely employed ensemble learning strategies: ensemble-averaging, bagging and stacking with advanced deep learning models for forecasting major cryptocurrency hourly prices. The proposed ensemble models were evaluated utilizing state-of-the-art deep learning models as component learners, which were comprised by combinations of long short-term memory (LSTM), Bi-directional LSTM and convolutional layers. The ensemble models were evaluated on prediction of the cryptocurrency price on the following hour (regression) and also on the prediction if the price on the following hour will increase or decrease with respect to the current price (classification). Additionally, the reliability of each forecasting model and the efficiency of its predictions is evaluated by examining for autocorrelation of the errors. Our detailed experimental analysis indicates that ensemble learning and deep learning can be efficiently beneficial to each other, for developing strong, stable, and reliable forecasting models.},

The obtained simplicia complex preserves all pertinent topological features of the reconstructed phase space and it may be analyzed from topological, combinatorial and algebraic aspects. In focus of this study is computation of homology of the invariant set of some well known dynamical systems which display chaotic behavior. Persistent homology of simplicial complex and its relationship with the embedding dimensions are examined by studying the lifetime of topological features and topological noise. The consistency of topological properties for different dynamic regimes and embedding dimensions is examined. The obtained results shed new light on the topological properties of the reconstructed phase space and open up new possibilities for application of advanced topological methods. The method presented here may be used as a generic method for constructing simplicial complex from a scalar time series which has a number of advantages compared to the the mapping of the same time series to a complex network.},

The goal is to ascertain with what accuracy can the direction of Bitcoin price in USD can be predicted. The price data is sourced from the Bitcoin Price Index . The task is achieved with varying degrees of success through the implementation of a Bayesian optimised recurrent neural network (RNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network. The LSTM achieves the highest classification accuracy of 52\% and a RMSE of 8\%. The popular ARIMA model for time series forecasting is implemented as a comparison to the deep learning models. As expected, the non-linear deep learning methods outperform the ARIMA forecast which performs poorly. Wavelets are explored as part of the time series narrative but not implemented for prediction purposes. Finally, both deep learning models are benchmarked on both a GPU and a CPU with the training time on the GPU outperforming the CPU implementation by 67.7\%.},

Central to our approach is the S[B] paradigm in which a complex system is represented by a two-level model. One level, the structural S one, is derived using the newly-introduced quantitative concept of persistent entropy, and it is described by a persistent entropy automaton. The other level, the behavioral B one, is characterized by a network of interacting computational agents. The presented methodology is applied to a real case study, the idiotypic network of the mammalian immune system.},

They are traded online, often with cryptocurrency, and are generally encoded within smart contracts on a blockchain. Public attention towards NFTs has exploded in 2021, when their market has experienced record sales, but little is known about the overall structure and evolution of its market. Here, we analyse data concerning 6.1 million trades of 4.7 million NFTs between June 23, 2017 and April 27, 2021, obtained primarily from Ethereum and WAX blockchains. First, we characterize statistical properties of the market. Second, we build the network of interactions, show that traders typically specialize on NFTs associated with similar objects and form tight clusters with other traders that exchange the same kind of objects. Third, we cluster objects associated to NFTs according to their visual features and show that collections contain visually homogeneous objects. Finally, we investigate the predictability of NFT sales using simple machine learning algorithms and find that sale history and, secondarily, visual features are good predictors for price. We anticipate that these findings will stimulate further research on NFT production, adoption, and trading in different contexts.},

  abstract = {A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},

  abstract = {Flooding Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks form the basis of services such as the electronic currency system Bitcoin. The decentralized architecture enables robustness against failure. However, knowledge of the network’s topology can allow adversaries to attack specific peers in order to, e.g., isolate certain peers or even partition the network. Knowledge of the topology might be gained by observing the flooding process, which is inherently possible in such networks, and performing a timing analysis on the observations. In this paper we present a timing analysis method that targets flooding P2P networks and show its theoretical and practical feasibility. A validation in the real-world Bitcoin network proves the possibility of inferring network links of actively participating peers with substantial precision and recall (both ∼ 40 \%), potentially enabling attacks on the network. Additionally, we analyze the countermeasure of trickling and quantify the tradeoff between the effectiveness of the countermeasure and the expected performance penalty. The analysis shows that inappropriate parametrization can actually facilitate inference attacks.},

We apply this methodology to quantifying periodicity in synthetic data sets, and compare the results with those obtained using state-of-the-art methods in gene expression analysis.

  abstract = {Timely failure detection for bearings is of great importance to prevent economic losses in the industry. In this article we propose a method based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to estimate the level of wear in roller bearings in each of its elements, inner race, outer race and rolling element. First of all, an automatic labeling of the raw vibration data for each element of the bearing is performed to obtain different levels of wear, by means of the Root-Mean-Square features along with the Shannon’s entropy to extract features from the raw data, which is then grouped in different classes using the K-means algorithm to obtain the labels for seventeen levels of degradation condition. Then, the raw vibration data is converted into small square images, each point of the data representing one pixel of the image. Following this, we propose a CNN model based on the AlexNet architecture to classify the wear level and diagnose the rotating system. To train the network and validate our proposal, we use a dataset from the center of Intelligent Maintenance Systems (IMS), and extensively compare it with other methods reported in the literature. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy proved to be excellent compared to other approaches in the state of the art.},

  abstract = {In last decade, cryptocurrency has emerged in financial area as a key factor in businesses and financial market opportunities. Accurate predictions can assist cryptocurrency investors towards right investing decisions and lead to potential increased profits. Additionally, they can also support policy makers and financial researchers in studying cryptocurrency markets behavior. Nevertheless, cryptocurrency price prediction is considered a very challenging task, due to its chaotic and very complex nature. In this study we evaluate some of the most successful and widely used deep learning algorithms forecasting cryptocurrency prices. The results obtained, provide significant evidence that deep learning models are not able to solve this problem efficiently and effectively. Conducting detailed experimentation and results analysis, we conclude that it is essential to invent and incorporate new techniques, strategies and alternative approaches such as: more sophisticated prediction algorithms, advanced ensemble methods, feature engineering techniques and other validation metrics.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The ability to share social network data at the level of individual connections is beneficial to science: not only for reproducing results, but also for researchers who may wish to use it for purposes not foreseen by the data releaser. Sharing such data, however, can lead to serious privacy issues, because individuals could be re-identified, not only based on possible nodes’ attributes, but also from the structure of the network around them. The risk associated with re-identification can be measured and it is more serious in some networks than in others. While various optimization algorithms have been proposed to anonymize networks, there is still only a limited theoretical understanding of which network features are important for the privacy problem. Using network models and real data, we show that the average degree of networks is a crucial parameter for the severity of re-identification risk from nodes’ neighborhoods. Dense networks are more at risk, and, apart from a small band of average degree values, either almost all nodes are uniquely re-identifiable or they are all safe. Our results allow researchers to assess the privacy risk based on a small number of network statistics which are available even before the data is collected. As a rule-of-thumb, the privacy risks are high if the average degree is above 10. Guided by these results, we explore sampling of edges as a strategy to mitigate the re-identification risk of nodes. This approach can be implemented during the data collection phase, and its effect on various network measures can be estimated and corrected using sampling theory. The new understanding of the uniqueness of neighborhoods in networks presented in this work can support the development of privacy-aware ways of designing network data collection procedures, anonymization methods, and sharing network data.},

  abstract = {The paper adds new translation knowledge to our 2014 paper: “The Sumerian K8538 tablet, the great meteor impact devastating Mesopotamia”. We present an improved, detailed fixing of the meteor impact day and impact hour, according to data provided on the tablet. A sky map for Northern Taurids meteor showers shows the comet flight path in the sky. Other useful information is given concerning climatic change, following the meteor impact, the meteor impact aftermath and new details for the relation of the cosmic impact to the Christian Bible, in particularly to Genesis and Apocalypse. The meteor impact occurred at 10:56 am, on September 22, 2193 BC, after the meteor emerged at 5:34 am at dawn and after a flight time of 5 hours 22 minutes. These numbers can clearly be deduced out of observation data entries in the tablet’s pictographic records and in comparison to LOD (length-of-day tables) for the corresponding Mesopotamian latitude. The K8538 tablet is property of the British Museum. Unfortunately, the museum is staunched in its opinion that this tablet represents the Babylonian sky as a so-called “planisphere”. This opinion is based on an interpretation, which we, for the first time, analyze in comprehensive detail, item by item, in this paper. Result: The planispheric concept of the Babylonian sky on this tablet is a hoax: Not one single correct argument proves alleged recorded planispheric constellations on the tablet, except one, already found by L. W. King, over 100 years ago, back in 1912. As translated in our 2014 K8538 paper, the tablet has never been a planisphere, but is a pictographic “cartoon” story, probably the first recorded cartoon of the world, consisting of a sequence of 8 subsequent pictures, to be turned while reading, to advance the story. All 8 pictures exclusively show observations, recorded measurements and specific details of flight and impact of this disastrous meteor, which destroyed the nearby Akkadian capital in Mesopotamia. Because Southern Iraq in the impact area was swamp and marshland until recently, an exploration of the discovered impact crater, Umm-al-Binni, was impossible. For the first time, it is feasible from 2019 on, and a first crater inspection will soon be conducted. Due to missing explorations of the impact crater, Near-East historians, until now, did not recognize the historical cosmic impact event, but we may expect that this will change in the near future.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, Bitcoin has become the most popular cryptocurrency, which gains the attention of investors and speculators alike. Asset pricing is a risky and challenging activity that enchants lots of shareholders. Indeed, the difficulty in making predictions lies in understanding the multiple factors that affect the Bitcoin price trend. Modeling the market behavior and thus, the sentiment in the Bitcoin ecosystem provides an insight into the predictions of the Bitcoin price. While there are significant studies that investigate the token economics based on the Bitcoin network, limited research has been performed to analyze the network sentiment on the overall Bitcoin price. In this paper, we investigate the predictive power of network sentiments and explore statistical and deep-learning methods to predict Bitcoin future price. In particular, we analyze financial and sentiment features extracted from economic and crowdsourced data respectively, and we show how the sentiment is the most significant factor in predicting Bitcoin market stocks. Next, we compare two models used for Bitcoin time-series predictions: the Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous input (ARIMAX) and the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). We demonstrate that both models achieve optimal results on new predictions, with a mean squared error lower than 0.14\%, due to the inclusion of the studied sentiment feature. Besides, since the ARIMAX achieves better predictions than the RNN, we also prove that, with just a linear model, we may obtain outstanding market forecasts in the Bitcoin scenario.},

  abstract = {Financial time series forecasting is undoubtedly the top choice of computational intelligence for finance researchers in both academia and the finance industry due to its broad implementation areas and substantial impact. Machine Learning (ML) researchers have created various models, and a vast number of studies have been published accordingly. As such, a significant number of surveys exist covering ML studies on financial time series forecasting. Lately, Deep Learning (DL) models have appeared within the field, with results that significantly outperform their traditional ML counterparts. Even though there is a growing interest in developing models for financial time series forecasting, there is a lack of review papers that solely focus on DL for finance. Hence, the motivation of this paper is to provide a comprehensive literature review of DL studies on financial time series forecasting implementation. We not only categorized the studies according to their intended forecasting implementation areas, such as index, forex, and commodity forecasting, but we also grouped them based on their DL model choices, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Deep Belief Networks (DBNs), and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM). We also tried to envision the future of the field by highlighting its possible setbacks and opportunities for the benefit of interested researchers.},
