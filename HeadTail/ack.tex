\chapter*{Agradecimientos}
%I would like to express my deep and heartfelt gratitude for my respected guide and mentor, Dr. -, for his evergreen blessings, valuable advice, support, good wishes and encouragement all alone the journey of this work. Without his undisputed support, this work would not have been true in the light of daylight. I am also grateful to the members of my Doctoral Committee (Dr.  -, Dr.  -, and Dr. -) for reviewing my works and for their valuable comments.
